      <li class="li"><strong class="strong">Runnable Service Overview.</strong> Runnable is a sandbox as a service, on-demand software testing environment, which allows users to create, test, and collaborate on software development in real time.
      <li class="li"><strong class="strong">Eligibility.</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are at least 18 years of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or other organization (your “<strong class="strong">Organization</strong>”), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind your Organization to these Terms, you agree to bind your Organization to these Terms, and you have the permission of your Organization to create an account.
      <li class="li"><strong class="strong">Accounts and Registration.</strong> To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself or your Organization, such as email address or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at <a href="mailto:support@runnable.com" class="link">support@runnable.com</a>.
      <li class="li"><strong class="strong">Payment.</strong> You may be required to pay fees to access the Service or certain features of the Service. All fees are charged as one payment per month to the card on file for each Organization. The first user in the Organization to provide a payment method will be responsible for all fees incurred on behalf of the Organization, including all fees for current and future Organization accounts and users. To update the payment method, an Organization user can provide a new payment method, which will be used for all future Organization charges from that point forward. All fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If Runnable changes the fees for all or part of the Service, including by adding fees or charges, Runnable will provide you advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, Runnable may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Service to you. Runnable will charge the payment method specified for your Organization at the time of purchase. You authorize Runnable to charge all fees as described in these Terms for the Service you select to that payment method, and you represent and warrant that you have the permission of your Organization to charge all sums. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Runnable may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account before your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. The Service may include functionality for activating, updating, or canceling recurring payments for periodic charges. If you activate or update recurring payments through the Service, you authorize Runnable to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. If you use the Service to update or cancel any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take up to [number of days] business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.

      <li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">Runnable Service Overview.</strong> Runnable provides full-stack development and test environments for code branches in a hosted git repository (like GitHub or Bitbucket), allowing users to create, test, and collaborate on software development in real time.
      <li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">Eligibility.</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are at least 18 years of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or other organization (your “<strong class="weight-strong">Organization</strong>”), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind your Organization to these Terms, you agree to bind your Organization to these Terms, and you have the permission of your Organization to create an account.
      <li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">Accounts and Registration.</strong> To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself or your Organization, such as email address or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you may be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at <a href="mailto:accounts@runnable.com" class="link">accounts@runnable.com</a>.
      <li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">Payment.</strong> You may be required to pay fees to access the Service or certain features of the Service. All fees are charged as one payment per month to the payment method on file for each Organization. The first user in the Organization to provide a payment method will be responsible for all fees incurred on behalf of the Organization, including all fees for current and future Organization accounts and users. To update the payment method, an Organization user can provide a new payment method, which will be used for all future Organization charges from that point forward. All fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If Runnable changes the fees for all or part of the Service, including by adding fees or charges, Runnable will provide you advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, Runnable may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Service to you. Runnable will charge the payment method specified for your Organization at the time of purchase. You authorize Runnable to charge all fees as described in these Terms for the Service you select to that payment method, and you represent and warrant that you have the permission of your Organization to charge all sums. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Runnable may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account before your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. The Service may include functionality for activating, updating, or canceling recurring payments for periodic charges. If you activate or update recurring payments through the Service, you authorize Runnable to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. If you use the Service to update or cancel any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take up to 7 business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.

By sharing an Environment Link with Reviewers, you grant those Reviewers a non-exclusive license to access and use that Application and related Application Content as permitted by these Terms and the functionality of the Service. You are responsible for the Reviewers’ actions on the Service and for ensuring that the Reviewers comply with these Terms. If Reviewers, in testing the Application, create or upload any code, images, data, text, or other content, that content will be considered Application Content.

You are solely responsible for your Applications and Application Content and the consequences of making Applications and Application Content available to Runnable or Reviewers. By uploading an Application and Application Content to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are the creator and owner of the Application and Application Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Runnable and Reviewers to access and use your Application and Application Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in these Terms in the manner contemplated by Runnable, the Service, and these Terms.

We are under no obligation to edit or control any Application, or any Application Content that you, Reviewers, or other users of the Service make available through an Application, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for any Application or Application Content. Runnable may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any Application Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable, including by blocking or removing an Application. You understand that when using the Service you may be exposed to Application Content from Reviewers or other users and acknowledge that Application Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Runnable with respect to any Application or Application Content. We expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with Applications. If notified by a user or content owner that Application Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the Application Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, Runnable does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Service.

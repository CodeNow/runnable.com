    <p class="p">We’re thrilled to announce the Runnable team is joining <a class="link" href="//mulesoft.com">MuleSoft</a>. This is an incredible opportunity for us to expand our vision of empowering developers to test changes without the infrastructure bottleneck; we couldn’t be more excited to work with MuleSoft to continue our journey.</p>
    <p class="p">While cloud-hosted accounts have been sunset, Runnable’s self-hosted accounts will continue to be supported under this acquisition. <a class="link" href="//code.runnable.com">Runnable CodeSnippets</a> will also continue to be a great place to try and share code.</p>
    <p class="p"> For those we had the joy of serving, thank you very much for your support and feedback. Know this isn’t goodbye – we’ll continue serving all our self-hosted customers, and we’re looking forward to sharing what’s next.</p>
    <p class="p text-gray">💜 All of us @ Runnable</p>

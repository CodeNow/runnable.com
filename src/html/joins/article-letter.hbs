    <p class="p">Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the Runnable team is joining. This is an incredible opportunity for us to expand our vision of empowering developers to test changes without the infrastructure bottleneck; we couldnâ€™t be more excited to work with to continue our journey.</p>
    <p class="p">While cloud-hosted accounts have been sunset, Runnableâ€™s self-hosted accounts will continue to be supported under this acquisition. Runnable CodeSnippets (code.runnable.com) will also continue to be a great place to try and share code.</p>
    <p class="p">For those we had the joy of serving, thank you very much for your support and feedback. Now know this isnâ€™t goodbyeâ€‰â€”â€‰weâ€™ll continue serving all our self-hosted customers, and weâ€™re looking forward to sharing whatâ€™s next.</p>

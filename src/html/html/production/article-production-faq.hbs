    <h3 class="grid-content shrink h3 justify-center weight-strong"><span class="em">Q:</span> Does Runnable provide container hosting?</h3>
    <p class="grid-content shrink p justify-center">Runnable hosts containers in order to provide working environments that are accessible to anyone; however, these environments are not intended to replace heavy workloads typical of production. Runnable containers are suitable for lightweight usage, and are easily exportable to other, more robust platforms designed for production.

  <div class="grid-block vertical question">
    <h3 class="grid-content shrink h3 justify-center weight-strong"><span class="em">Q:</span> How is this different from Docker Cloud or Tutum?</h3>
    <p class="grid-content shrink p justify-center">Runnable complements your team’s workflow to simplify creating environments to test code changes. The assets used to generate these environments are also ready for production deployments. Runnable charges a flat fee per user, not by resource usage.

  <div class="grid-block vertical question">
    <h3 class="grid-content shrink h3 justify-center weight-strong"><span class="em">Q:</span> Do I need to use Docker?</h3>
    <p class="grid-content shrink p justify-center">No. Our setup process was built to easily onboard applications regardless of whether they are Dockerized.

  <div class="grid-block vertical question">
    <h3 class="grid-content shrink h3 justify-center weight-strong"><span class="em">Q:</span> How secure is my code?</h3>
    <p class="grid-content shrink p justify-center">Your code is only transferred to an isolated set of servers that are not accessible to any other users. This is commonly referred to as <strong class="weight-strong">single-tenant infrastructure</strong>. Runnable also undergoes regular security audits to ensure your code stays secure.

  <div class="grid-block vertical question">
    <h3 class="grid-content shrink h3 justify-center weight-strong"><span class="em">Q:</span> What does the setup process look like?</h3>
    <p class="grid-content shrink p justify-center">For many teams, it’s as easy as selecting your repositories, adding in environment variables or replace rules (for hard-coded values), and then saving. Adding databases and other services is also point-and-click. You’ll be invited to join our engineering team’s Slack, so you’ll have direct access to our entire team to help with setup. We can even set up your app for you. :)

    <p class="p">  Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the Runnable team is joining <a class="link" href="//mulesoft.com">MuleSoft</a>. This is an incredible opportunity for us to expand our vision of empowering developers to test changes without the infrastructure bottleneck; we couldnâ€™t be more excited to work with MuleSoft to continue our journey.</p>
    <p class="p">As apart of this transition, weâ€™re shutting down service for all Runnable accounts. To those we had the joy of serving, thank you very much for your support and feedback. Know this isnâ€™t goodbyeâ€‰â€”â€‰weâ€™re looking forward to sharing whatâ€™s next.</p>

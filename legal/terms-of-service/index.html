You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at <a href="mailto:accounts@runnable.com" class="link">accounts@runnable.com</a>.
      </li><li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">Payment.</strong> You may be required to pay fees to access the Service or certain features of the Service. All fees are charged as one payment per month to the payment method on file for each Organization. The first user in the Organization to provide a payment method will be responsible for all fees incurred on behalf of the Organization, including all fees for current and future Organization accounts and users. To update the payment method, an Organization user can provide a new payment method, which will be used for all future Organization charges from that point forward. All fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If Runnable changes the fees for all or part of the Service, including by adding fees or charges, Runnable will provide you advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, Runnable may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Service to you. Runnable will charge the payment method specified for your Organization at the time of purchase. You authorize Runnable to charge all fees as described in these Terms for the Service you select to that payment method, and you represent and warrant that you have the permission of your Organization to charge all sums. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Runnable may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account before your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. The Service may include functionality for activating, updating, or canceling recurring payments for periodic charges. If you activate or update recurring payments through the Service, you authorize Runnable to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. If you use the Service to update or cancel any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take up to 7 business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.

You understand that when using the Service you may be exposed to Application Content from Reviewers or other users and acknowledge that Application Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Runnable with respect to any Application or Application Content.

All Additional Terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.

        <br><br>EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 17 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
      </li><li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">Governing Law</strong>. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then you and Runnable agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating any dispute. We operate the Service from our offices in California, and we make no representation that Materials or  the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.
      </li><li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">General</strong>. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Runnable regarding your use of the Service. Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 2, 4, and 6 through 21, along with the Privacy Policy and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.
      </li><li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>.
        <ol class="ol">
          <li class="li" start="19"><strong class="weight-strong">Generally</strong>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Runnable in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Runnable agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Runnable ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
          </li><li class="li" start="19"><strong class="weight-strong">Exceptions</strong>. Despite the provisions of Section 20.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
          </li><li class="li" start="19"><strong class="weight-strong">Arbitrator</strong>. Any arbitration between you and Runnable will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<strong class="weight-strong">AAA Rules</strong>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong class="weight-strong">AAA</strong>”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Runnable.
          </li><li class="li" start="19"><strong class="weight-strong">Notice; Process</strong>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<strong class="weight-strong">Notice</strong>”). Runnable’s address for Notice is: Runnable, Inc., 1481 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94103. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong class="weight-strong">Demand</strong>”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Runnable may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Runnable must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Runnable will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Runnable in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.
          </li><li class="li" start="19"><strong class="weight-strong">Fees</strong>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Runnable will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Runnable for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
          </li><li class="li" start="19"><strong class="weight-strong">No Class Actions</strong>. YOU AND Runnable AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Runnable agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
          </li><li class="li" start="19"><strong class="weight-strong">Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</strong>. If Runnable makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Runnable’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Runnable’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Runnable will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
          </li><li class="li" start="19"><strong class="weight-strong">Enforceability</strong>. If Section 20.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 20 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 20 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
        </li></ol>
      </li><li class="li"><strong class="weight-strong">Consent to Electronic Communications</strong>. By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.
